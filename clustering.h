/** @brief Finds centers of clusters and groups input samples around the clusters.

The function kmeans implements a k-means algorithm that finds the centers of cluster_count clusters
and groups the input samples around the clusters. As an output, \f$\texttt{labels}_i\f$ contains a
0-based cluster index for the sample stored in the \f$i^{th}\f$ row of the samples matrix.

@param data Data for clustering. An array of N-Dimensional points with float coordinates is needed.
Examples of this array can be:
-   Mat points(count, 2, CV_32F);
-   Mat points(count, 1, CV_32FC2);
-   Mat points(1, count, CV_32FC2);
-   std::vector\<cv::Point2f\> points(sampleCount);
@param K Number of clusters to split the set by.
@param bestLabels Input/output integer array that stores the cluster indices for every sample.
@param criteria The algorithm termination criteria, that is, the maximum number of iterations and/or
the desired accuracy. The accuracy is specified as criteria.epsilon. As soon as each of the cluster
centers moves by less than criteria.epsilon on some iteration, the algorithm stops.
@param attempts Flag to specify the number of times the algorithm is executed using different
initial labellings. The algorithm returns the labels that yield the best compactness (see the last
function parameter).
@param flags Flag that can take values of cv::KmeansFlags
@param centers Output matrix of the cluster centers, one row per each cluster center.
@param fun metric to use for clustering, if null or nullptr, the norm L2 is used.
@return The function returns the compactness measure that is computed as
\f[\sum _i  \| \texttt{samples} _i -  \texttt{centers} _{ \texttt{labels} _i} \| ^2\f]
after every attempt. The best (minimum) value is chosen and the corresponding labels and the
compactness value are returned by the function. Basically, you can use only the core of the
function, set the number of attempts to 1, initialize labels each time using a custom algorithm,
pass them with the ( flags = KMEANS_USE_INITIAL_LABELS ) flag, and then choose the best
(most-compact) clustering.
